                          <p>I am a web developer, with education and experience in full stack developing. My background in
                          small business management gives me the skills to understand the importance of structure, problem
                          solving, and planning. </p>
                          <p>Fueled by passion for learning, I consider myself a person who refuses to only know the minimal
                              of any skill, or to complete any project without doing the best I can. I am willing to learn 
                              all aspects of any skill to perfect it to the best of my ability.
                          </p>
                          <p>I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in Lambda School. I then chose to attend
                              University of Richmond's Full Stack coding bootcamp, where I increased my skills significantly, touching
                              basis on skills including MySQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, MERN Stack, jQuery, Bootstrap, Heroku, Git,
                              and Java.
                          </p>
                          <p>I am excited to continue to develop my knowledge and gain experience as a web developer in Richmond, VA.</p>
